## 🚀 Step-by-Step GitHub Setup

### **Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub Website**

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   - Open browser: https://github.com
   - You should already be logged in

2. **Start creating repository:**
   - Click the **green "New"** button (left sidebar)
   - OR click **"+"** icon (top right) → **"New repository"**

3. **Fill in repository details:**

   ```
   Owner: [Your GitHub username] (auto-filled)
   
   Repository name: LT-22222-L-Enhanced
   
   Description (optional but recommended):
   Enhanced LoRa P2P firmware for DRAGINO LT-22222-L with race condition fixes, 
   TX queueing, activity-based heartbeat, and performance optimizations
   
   Visibility:
   ○ Public  - Anyone can see (good for open source)
   ● Private - Only you can see (recommended for commercial)
   
   ⚠️ CRITICAL - Do NOT check these boxes:
   ☐ Add a README file       ← UNCHECK! (we have one)
   ☐ Add .gitignore          ← UNCHECK! (we have one)
   ☐ Choose a license        ← Leave unchecked (optional)
   ```

4. **Click the green "Create repository" button**

---

### **Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL**

After creating, GitHub shows a page like this:

```
Quick setup — if you've done this kind of thing before
HTTPS  SSH
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LT-22222-L-Enhanced.git
```

**Copy this URL!** You'll need it in the next step.

**Example:**
```
https://github.com/johndoe/LT-22222-L-Enhanced.git
         └─────┘
      Your username
```

---

### **Step 3: Connect Local Repository to GitHub**

Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to project (if not already there)
cd "C:\Users\Wagne\OneDrive\Programmierungen\LORA P2P\LT-22222-L"

# Add GitHub as remote
# REPLACE the URL below with YOUR repository URL from Step 2!
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LT-22222-L-Enhanced.git

# Verify it was added correctly
git remote -v
```

**Expected output:**
```
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LT-22222-L-Enhanced.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LT-22222-L-Enhanced.git (push)
```

---

### **Step 4: Push Your Code to GitHub**

```powershell
# Push your local commits to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**What happens:**
1. Git will upload your code to GitHub
2. Since Cursor is connected to GitHub, authentication should work automatically
3. You'll see progress as files are uploaded

**Expected output:**
```
Enumerating objects: XX, done.
Counting objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.
Writing objects: 100% (XX/XX), XX.XX MiB | XX.XX MiB/s, done.
Total XX (delta XX), reused XX (delta XX), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LT-22222-L-Enhanced.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.
```

---

### **Step 5: Verify Upload**

1. **Go back to GitHub in your browser**
2. **Refresh the repository page**
3. **You should now see:**
   - ✅ Your README.md displayed
   - ✅ File browser showing all your code
   - ✅ "1 commit" indicator
   - ✅ Green "Code" button

---

## 🎯 Daily Workflow (After Setup)

### **Making Changes:**

```powershell
# 1. Make changes to your code (edit main.c, etc.)
# 2. Test thoroughly
# 3. Check what changed:
git status

# 4. Add specific files:
git add Projects/Multi/Applications/LoRa/DRAGINO-LRWAN\(AT\)/src/main.c

# Or add all changes:
git add .

# 5. Commit with descriptive message:
git commit -m "Fixed XYZ issue"

# 6. Push to GitHub (backup):
git push
```

---

## 🏷️ Creating Releases

When your firmware reaches a stable milestone:

```powershell
# Tag the current version
git tag -a v1.3.5 -m "Stable release with optimizations"

# Push tag to GitHub
git push origin v1.3.5
```

**On GitHub:**
1. Go to repository → **Releases**
2. Click **"Create a new release"**
3. Select your tag (v1.3.5)
4. Add release notes
5. Attach compiled `.hex` file
6. Click **"Publish release"**

---

## 🔧 Useful Git Commands

```powershell
# View commit history
git log --oneline -10

# See what changed in last commit
git show

# Undo uncommitted changes
git restore main.c

# Create branch for experiments
git checkout -b feature/new-idea
# ... make changes ...
git commit -am "Testing new idea"

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Merge successful experiment
git merge feature/new-idea

# Or delete failed experiment
git branch -D feature/new-idea

# Pull latest from GitHub (if working on multiple PCs)
git pull

# Clone on another PC
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LT-22222-L-Enhanced.git
```

## 🛡️ Best Practices

### **Commit Often:**
```
✅ After fixing a bug
✅ After adding a feature
✅ Before trying something risky
✅ At end of work session
```

### **Good Commit Messages:**
```
✅ "Fixed infinite loop when DI interrupt fires during heartbeat"
✅ "Added FAST_MODE to reduce latency"
✅ "Optimized receiver output mapping logic"

❌ "Update"
❌ "Fix"
❌ "Changes"
```

### **Use Branches:**
```
main          ← Stable, tested code
development   ← Active development
feature/abc   ← Experimental features
bugfix/xyz    ← Bug fixes
```

## 🚨 Important Security Note

**If using Private repository:**
- Your code is only visible to you
- Good for commercial/proprietary projects
- Can add collaborators later

**If using Public repository:**
- Anyone can see your code
- Good for open source
- ⚠️ Don't commit passwords, API keys, or secrets!

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Authentication Failed**

**Solution 1: Use GitHub Desktop**
1. Download: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Install and sign in
3. File → Add local repository → Choose your project folder
4. Push button in GitHub Desktop

**Solution 2: Personal Access Token (PAT)**
1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate new token
3. Select scope: `repo` (full control)
4. Copy token
5. When git asks for password, paste the token

**Solution 3: SSH Key**
1. Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
2. Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
3. Change remote URL: `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/LT-22222-L-Enhanced.git`

---

### **Issue: Large Files**

If you get errors about file size:

```powershell
# Compiled .hex files might be large
# Add to .gitignore if too big:
echo "*.hex" >> .gitignore

# Or use Git LFS for large files:
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.hex"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Track hex files with LFS"
```

---

## ✅ Quick Verification Checklist

After setup, verify:

- [ ] Repository exists on GitHub
- [ ] README.md displays correctly
- [ ] Can see your commit in "Commits" tab
- [ ] Can browse source code online
- [ ] `git push` works without errors
- [ ] `git pull` works without errors

---

## 🎉 You're Done!

Once setup is complete:
- 💾 Your code is backed up on GitHub
- 🔄 You can sync between multiple PCs
- 👥 You can collaborate with others
- 📊 You have full version history
- ⏪ You can revert to any previous version

**Next commit:**
```powershell
# Just make changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

**That's it!** 🚀
