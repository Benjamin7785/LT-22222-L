GitHub Setup Commands
=====================

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

IMPORTANT: Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username!

# Navigate to project directory
cd "C:\Users\Wagne\OneDrive\Programmierungen\LORA P2P\LT-22222-L"

# Add GitHub as remote (REPLACE YOUR_USERNAME!)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LT-22222-L-Enhanced.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub (first time)
git push -u origin main

# For subsequent pushes (after more commits)
git push

TROUBLESHOOTING
=================

If you get authentication errors:
1. GitHub may ask you to authenticate
2. Since Cursor is already connected to GitHub, it should work automatically
3. If not, you may need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT):
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Generate new token (classic)
   - Select scopes: "repo" (full control of private repositories)
   - Copy the token
   - Use it as password when git asks

Alternative (easier):
Install GitHub Desktop app - it handles authentication automatically:
https://desktop.github.com/
